❓ Question:
Write a function called dayActivity(day) that takes a day of the week as a string (e.g., "Monday", "Friday") and returns an activity for that day. Use a switch statement to decide the activity:
Monday → "Gym workout"
Tuesday → "Study JavaScript"
Wednesday → "Grocery shopping"
Thursday → "Go for a run"
Friday → "Watch a movie"
Saturday → "Hang out with friends"
Sunday → "Rest and relax"
If the day does not match any of these, return "Invalid day"
